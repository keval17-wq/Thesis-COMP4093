The restaurant offers a welcoming ambiance, particularly the outdoor seating area, which patrons enjoy. The quality of desserts and vegetarian options receives positive feedback, with special mention of the tiramisu. However, there are repeated complaints about slow service, overpriced dishes, loud music, and watered-down drinks. While takeout service is efficient, dine-in experiences are inconsistent and often chaotic. Improving service efficiency and enhancing the quality of beverages would significantly enhance customer satisfaction.
