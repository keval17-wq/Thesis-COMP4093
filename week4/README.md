## Week 4 Logbook Entry
**Discussion Points**  
- Developed an initial version of the hybrid summarization system combining extractive (TF-IDF) and GPT-based abstractive summarization.  
- Reviewed relevant research papers validating hybrid approaches.  
- Discussed the potential for integrating sentiment analysis as an enhancement.

**Work Completed**  
- Produced a working prototype of the hybrid summarization model (Scenario 4).  
- Gathered insights into how sentiment cues might further refine the summary.

**Work Being Completed**  
- Investigating methods to integrate sentiment analysis as an auxiliary feature.  
- Evaluating research findings to inform improvements in the hybrid model.

**Plan for Week 5**  
- Implement benchmark summaries and integrate ROUGE evaluation metrics.  
- Begin comparative tests between the hybrid model and a novelty model with sentiment integration (Scenario 5).

**Queries for Clarification**  
- Should sentiment influence the extraction phase, the summarization prompt, or both?
