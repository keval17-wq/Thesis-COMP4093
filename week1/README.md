## Week 1 Logbook Entry
**Discussion Points**  
- Revisited the scope of the thesis post-break.  
- Reviewed prior semester's experiments and preliminary thesis report.  
- Established a refreshed project direction and objectives.

**Work Completed**  
- Re-evaluated previous clustering experiments and identified shortcomings.  
- Submitted an updated preliminary thesis progress report.

**Work Being Completed**  
- Aligning previous methodologies with the new project scope.  
- Reviewing literature and identifying areas for improvement.

**Plan for Week 2**  
- Begin testing clustering approaches at scale.  
- Log performance, execution time, and effectiveness of clustering on selected datasets.

**Queries for Clarification**
