ðŸª¤ Misdirection Set â€” Set 1
Fast charging and great feel in hand, but battery drains in two hours.

Easy to pair and use â€” then lost connection every five minutes.

Love the big display and UI, but it crashed three times on setup.

Works well in daylight â€” useless once it's dark though.

Looks amazing, sleek and polished â€” overheated in 10 minutes.

Keyboard feels great, but keys stop responding after 3 weeks.

Smooth multitasking until it randomly froze mid-meeting.

Photos are crisp and colorful, though it forgot to save half of them.

Comfy earbuds, but one side just stopped working next day.

Notifications come quick, but the app takes forever to open.

The product is sleek with a good keyboard and fast charging. It's easy to use, supports multitasking, and has a large, user-friendly display. It provides quick notifications, clear photos, and comfortable earbuds. However, it overheats quickly, has key and battery issues, loses connection often, and can freeze. It crashed during setup, the app is slow, it doesn't always save photos, one earbud failed quickly, and it's ineffective in the dark.

The device offers fast charging, a great in-hand feel, and a big, user-friendly display, but it experiences rapid battery drain and frequent connectivity drops. It functions well in daylight but becomes nearly useless in low light. While pairing and using the device are straightforward, the setup process is marred by crashes. The design is sleek, but overheating occurs quickly. The keyboard initially feels great, but its functionality deteriorates after a few weeks. Multitasking is smooth until the device unexpectedly freezes during use. Photos are crisp and colorful, though some are not saved, and the earbuds are comfortable but suffer from one side failing shortly after use. Notifications are quick, yet the app itself takes time to open.
