# Week 12 Logbook Entry

## Discussion Points
- Locked in final results, all experimental tables completed.
- System narrative was still: “SC5 is better across all phases.”
- Presentation prep and thesis polishing began in parallel.

## Work Completed
- Finalised all summary outputs, logs, and graphs for thesis submission.
- Laid out ideal summaries and comparison results cleanly in Appendix A and B.
- G-Eval results showed consistent coherence and content inclusion across test sets.

## Key Observations
- System appeared stable: no hallucinations observed at this stage.
- BERTScore still not re-integrated due to unresolved bug.

## Work Being Completed
- Final Streamlit deploy push for demonstration purposes.
- Thesis formatting, bibliography cleaning, and last QA pass.

## Plan for Week 13
- Present results to supervisor.
- Deliver final thesis PDF and oral presentation content.
- Receive any last-minute critique.

## Queries
- Is it valuable to cite summary/input length ratio averages?
- Should hallucination check methods be footnoted or foregrounded?
