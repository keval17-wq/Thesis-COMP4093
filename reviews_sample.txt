Premium look. Touchscreen stopped responding day 2.

Quick support replies. All told me to reboot.

Loved the interface — until it turned Mandarin randomly.

Helps me sleep — mostly out of frustration.

Snaps perfect photos — if you enjoy mystery blurs.

Holds charge well… until 20%, then dies in minutes.

Speakers are bold — they hum when nothing plays.

Firmware update bricked it. Thanks!

Works flawlessly in airplane mode. Just not otherwise.

The cable is braided, strong… and doesn’t fit.
