## Week 3 Logbook Entry
**Discussion Points**  
- Discontinued the clustering-based summarization approach due to inconsistent outcomes.  
- Shifted focus toward developing a prototype novelty-based summarizer independent of clustering.

**Work Completed**  
- Initiated prototyping of a novelty model using TF-IDF for sentence scoring.  
- Developed a basic pipeline to simulate summary flows based on novelty extraction.

**Work Being Completed**  
- Refining sentence filtering criteria based on saliency and uniqueness.  
- Designing the logic for novelty-first filtering prior to GPT-based summarization.

**Plan for Week 4**  
- Build and test a hybrid summarization flow combining extractive and abstractive methods.  
- Integrate GPT summary generation at the end of the novelty filtering process.

**Queries for Clarification**  
- Should novelty be measured solely by uniqueness, or should relevance also be weighted?
