The product, marketed as reliable and clear, is faulty and fuzzy. Sensor improvements didn't prevent misses. The quick lock jams and a part wobbles despite sturdiness. Precision is off by inches. It cooks evenly with adjustments. Fast delivery resulted in a damaged box. It handles load but grinds under stress. Advertised as universal, it doesn't fit all.
