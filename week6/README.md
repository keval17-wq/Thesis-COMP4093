## Week 6 Logbook Entry

### **Discussion Points**  
- Significant disruptions occurred due to a **Mac OS update**, which resulted in **broken paths and disrupted Python modules**.  
- Attempts to replace and reinstall all required modules failed repeatedly due to path errors and compatibility issues.  
- The majority of the week was spent troubleshooting, rebuilding the environment, and restoring previous functionalities.  
- Despite the technical disruptions, **all 30 summaries were prepared before the meeting** along with their **ideal summaries and source reviews, ready for testing and comparison**.  
- During the Friday meeting last week (**Friday of Week 6**), the solution to the persistent environment issues was determined.  

### **Work Completed**  
- Identified conflicting paths and repaired the environment by systematically removing and reinstalling problematic modules.  
- Reconfigured the Python environment, including updating the `PATH` variable and ensuring compatibility with external libraries.  
- Performed diagnostic runs to ensure the modules functioned correctly before resuming experiments.  
- By the time of the **Friday meeting last week (Week 6)**, I had all **30 summaries, their ideal summaries, and source reviews** ready for evaluation.  
- Instead of relying on the local machine, I utilized **GitHub Codespace** to continue the research work uninterrupted.  
- Confirmed that all test kits were prepared and saved to the repository for further evaluation and analysis.  

### **Work Being Completed**  
- Preparing to resume comparative testing of Scenario 4 and Scenario 5 on **GitHub Codespace**.  
- Reviewing literature on effective hybridization of extractive and sentiment-aware approaches.  
- Enhancing documentation to reflect technical disruptions and solutions applied.  

### **Plan for Week 7**  
- Complete the **30-test kit run** with the newly established environment on GitHub Codespace.  
- Evaluate results and determine if Scenario 5's novelty approach shows consistent improvements.  
- Compare ROUGE scores and cosine similarity across all tests.  

### **Queries for Clarification**  
- What are the best practices for recovering broken environments in the future?  
- How to ensure compatibility between Mac OS updates and the Python environment?  
- Is reliance on GitHub Codespace a viable long-term solution, or should I continue troubleshooting the local environment?
