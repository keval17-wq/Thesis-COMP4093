Final Abstractive Summary:
The summary indicates a strong dissatisfaction with various service providers including a dentist, a hairdresser, and restaurants. The complainant underwent an extremely negative experience at the dentist's office, where they were left with severe tooth pain due to a mismanaged filling, exacerbated by the perceived unprofessional behavior of the dentist and staff. The reviewer also expressed disappointment over a hair trim which did not match their description and was poorly executed, resulting in uneven layers and length. Further complaints include average food serving at a place where the brown rice was bland, the chicken was scarce, and the hot Chinese red chili peppers were too much. There was also criticism about a store's offerings that seemed overpriced and a change in arcade policy regarding under 21's was disliked. Despite these disappointments, there were favorable impressions from a Toronto visitor who seemed satisfied with their experience.
