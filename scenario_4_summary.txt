The customer service experience is marked by politeness from staff, despite inconsistencies in their problem-solving abilities. Customers occasionally have to deal with frequent phone line disconnections during calls, which can be frustrating. When customers do manage to connect with an agent with sufficient knowledge, the service experience significantly improves. However, there are notable issues with a slow, bureaucratic complaint resolution process. Even when the staff are well-mannered, they often struggle to provide satisfactory solutions to issues.
