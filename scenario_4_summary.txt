The staff at the restaurant is friendly but the service is notably slow, particularly for dine-in customers which results in a chaotic experience. Although their takeout service shows efficiency, the quality of their drinks is substandard with accusations of them being watered down and overpriced. On a positive note, the menu offers a commendable range of options for vegetarians and the outdoor seating area provides a delightful ambiance.
