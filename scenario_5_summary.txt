Despite friendly staff, the service was slow, the dining chaotic, and takeout efficient. Drinks were diluted and costly. Vegetarian options and tiramisu were praised. The outdoor seating was lovely, but marred by loud music. Undercooked pasta had tasty sauce. Customers found it overpriced and wouldn't return.
