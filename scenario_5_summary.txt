The main points from user feedback are centered around concerns of app functionality, user interface, and content pertinence. Users pointed out that the app regularly crashes on Android devices, showing potential compatibility issues, and it is also criticized for lack of customization options. The recommendation and news sourcing algorithms raise concerns due to perceived bias and inability to filter unreliable sources. Another problem seen from feedback is the lack of regional news coverage. Ads are viewed as intrusive, disrupting the reading experience. The offline reading mode, despite being found convenient, is reported to be buggy. The number of push notifications is seen as excessive and often irrelevant. Furthermore, users have encountered outdated or duplicated articles. Despite these issues, accolades were given for the range of news sources and the recommendation system, when it's working correctly. Overall, these feedback remarks suggest users appreciate the news range and recommendation system but find issues with app performance, content quality, and user experience.
