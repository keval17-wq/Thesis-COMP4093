Friendly staff offers efficient takeout, but dine-in faces slow service and loud music. The ambiance is nice with an outdoor area. Pasta tends to be undercooked yet sauce and vegetarian options are superb. Portions are small but tasty, desserts, particularly tiramisu, are delectable. Drinks are diluted and costly, not matching food quality. Hence, a revisit is doubtful.
