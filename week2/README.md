## Week 2 Logbook Entry
**Discussion Points**  
- Initiated the first full-scale clustering tests with large volumes of reviews.  
- Evaluated the feasibility of KMeans and traditional TF-IDF-based approaches.

**Work Completed**  
- Implemented the clustering pipeline and conducted initial tests.  
- Logged performance metrics (execution time, cluster cohesion) on various cluster counts.

**Work Being Completed**  
- Analyzing the quality of clusters and their semantic coherence.  
- Comparing clustering outcomes on different dataset sizes.

**Plan for Week 3**  
- Decide whether to refine the clustering approach or pivot.  
- Begin exploring summarization methods independent of clustering.

**Queries for Clarification**  
- How can we effectively measure semantic cohesion within clusters?  
- At what point should we consider clustering inefficient for our objectives?
