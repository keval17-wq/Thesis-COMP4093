Users appreciate the frequent updates and clean design of the app, along with its fast and responsive interface when it works properly. The addition of Dark mode and helpful customer support are also praised. However, crucial areas of concern include the introduction of new bugs with updates, visual glitches in Dark mode, and occasional crashes on Android devices. Users feel that the subscription fee is high given the limited functionality. They find the search function unreliable and complain about the lack of a tutorial for new users. Inconsistent push notifications, slow response times from customer support, and the absence of an offline mode also limit the app's usability, especially during travel.

The feedback reveals there is appreciation for the teacher's use of interactive teaching methods, clarity in explaining concepts, provision of excellent resources, fair grading, and approachability. These elements make learning enjoyable and the course material easy to navigate. However, concerns exist about the pace of topic coverage, which is considered too fast. The teacher rarely responds to emails or messages, resulting in difficulties in getting clarifications. There is also evidence of favoritism, leading some students to feel neglected. Additionally, the lectures lack structure, the feedback on grading is generally vague and unhelpful, and the assignments are perceived as unnecessarily difficult. Despite these shortcomings, the overall sentiment suggests that the teacher displays strictness, but also has a genuine concern for student success.
