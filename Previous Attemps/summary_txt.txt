The patient was frustrated with Dr. Goldberg's staff because they seldom answer the phone despite repeated calls, a recurring issue with many NYC doctors. Frustrated by the service, the patient gave Dr. Goldberg a 2-star rating.

The individual has been a patient of Dr. Goldberg for over a decade, since he began his practice at MHMG. Dr. Goldberg has continually provided excellent care, focusing on the bigger picture of health and individual lifestyle. He discovered the patient's fibroids, something their previous gynecologist, Dr. Markoff, did not detect. Dr. Goldberg is thorough, non-judgmental, and ensures to explore all medical options, highlighting the importance of constant communication regarding any medical or personal changes.

The text is a negative review of Dr. Goldberg and his office in Arizona. The author suggests that the doctor is uncaring, focused more on co-pays than patient wellbeing and does not respect the financial constraints of his patients. The process of getting prescriptions is criticized, and the doctor's refusal to provide refills is highlighted as a problem. The office staff is described as unresponsive and ineffective, often failing to return calls. The author, their spouse and adult children have decided to leave the practice due to these issues.

The reviewer warns of unprofessional staff at a certain Doctor's office who failed to respond about a billing question. The Doctor suggested preventative services, knowing the reviewer was a student, which were not covered by insurance, resulting in an $800 bill. The office refused to aid in fixing the issue, stating it was the patient's responsibility to know their insurance coverage. The reviewer found the situations frustrating.

The food at this location is highly recommended, especially the wings, with "Wet Cajun" and seasoned salt wings as popular choices. Wing nights are on Mondays and Wednesdays, featuring $0.75 whole wings. The venue provides a family-friendly dining area and a pleasing bar, making it an enjoyable place for locals.

The wing sauce, primarily made of butter and hot sauce, lacks distinction despite the decently-sized and crispy wings priced at $1 each. The hot and extra hot sauces have similar taste and heat levels. The fish sandwich is satisfying with its large portion and decent side dishes.

The city driving range has poor facilities, including worn-out mats, no grass tees in April, and limited hours despite having lighting facilities. The range looks like an excavation site with no grass. Despite the potential profitability of such an establishment, the current owner poorly maintains it, only accepts cash, and offers subpar service. The hope is for a sale to a new owner who would improve it.

The location in question is criticized for poor conditions and service. Key issues include limited availability of tees, a cash-only policy, early closure despite installed lighting, unavailability of refreshments, overgrown weeds, and non-functioning batting cages. The author suggests the place needs a new owner to improve its conditions.

The golf range is bigger than expected, comparable to Scally's in Moon, although not as nice. The staff in the pro shop are friendly and the range is well marked with targets and hazards. However, there is an additional charge of $3 to hit off the grass, a practice not seen at other ranges. The price for golf balls is reasonable. The facility is for sale but plans to reopen for the next season.

The writer visited a soon-to-be-opened golf range which features a turf field, state-of-the-art tee boxes, and a modern club house. The writer is excited to visit again, especially with their children, when it opens on July 14th.

The customer had a negative experience at a store where they waited for an hour due to a representative's error while processing a phone trade-in. The customer advises against visiting this store due to poor service.

The map for the location on Yelp is inaccurate. Calling 412-271-9911 for directions is advised. They serve a delicious reuben.

The author and a friend visited Emil's, a restaurant they discovered after thrift shopping, known for a nostalgic atmosphere reminiscent of the 1940s and 50s. They found the location to be quite hidden and the establishment's aesthetics plain but comforting. The Reuben sandwiches they ordered were satisfying, although not comparable to those in New York. They noticed other dishes served looked delicious, with generous portions. Particularly impressive was a substantial $12.99 steak, intriguing chicken Parmesan special, and large fish sandwich that the author tried on a subsequent visit and praised highly. Despite a crowded lunchtime, their waitress was friendly and efficient. The reviewer admired Emil's for its old-world charm and good-value meals. However, they recommended using a navigation system to find the restaurant due to its hidden location.

The writer describes a hard-to-find restaurant, conveniently located opposite the Rankin Police Station, with a diverse menu. Their ribeye sandwich was large and tasty, and their partner enjoyed a pleasant fish sandwich. The service was quick and cheerful, and they plan to return.

The establishment offers great happy hour drink specials and delicious, crispy wings, with special wing nights every Tuesday and Thursday.
